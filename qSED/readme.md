# Notes on Quiescent SEDs

The final SEDs are in the txt/ directory - they are text files with wavelength (A) in the first column and flux for a dwarf located at 10 pc from the Sun (ergs/cm^2/s/A) in the second column. The wrapper program is getSED.pro, and getspec.pro is where the spectra are normalized and interpolated. 

Details on the optical templates used:
- B07M/ M0-M6 Bochanski et al. 2007
- S18M/ M7-M9 Schmidt et al. 2018, in prep. 
- S14L/ L0-L8 Schmidt et al. 2014a

Details for the IR spectra are in prism.txt and within the files themselves.
