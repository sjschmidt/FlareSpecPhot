	Abstract = {The relationship between age, rotation, and magnetic activity can be used to roughly estimate the ages of solar-type stars. At lower stellar masses, the relationship between activity and age changes due to the less efficient angular momentum loss, and may disappear entirely for ultracool (late-M and L) dwarfs. The detection of flares (as a tracer of magnetic activity) can be combined with kinematic tracers of age to explore the relationship between age and activity for ultracool dwarfs. The final data release of Gaia will provide time-resolved photometry of Gaia targets in the G filter, but the effect of flares in the G-band is not well understood. I use a simple flare model to estimate the conversion of flare magnitudes for M3-L5 dwarfs in the Johnson V-, SDSS r-, and Kepler- bands to the Gaia G-band. By applying those conversions to previously observed flare rates, I estimate that M0-M6 dwarfs will have a flare rate in Gaia of Rf,Gaia gtrsim 8.73 × 10-4 hr-1 deg-2, corresponding to a total of gtrsim 20,000 flares in the whole survey. If ultracool dwarfs have the same flare rate, I would expect a total of gtrsim 20 flares on M7-L5 dwarfs.},

	Abstract = {We have conducted a 4030 deg2 near-infrared proper motion survey using multi-epoch data from the Two Micron All-Sky Survey (2MASS). We find 2778 proper motion candidates, 647 of which are not listed in SIMBAD. After comparison to Digitized Sky Survey images, we find that 107 of our proper motion candidates lack counterparts at B, R, and I bands and are thus 2MASS-only detections. We present results of spectroscopic follow-up of 188 targets that include the infrared-only sources along with selected optical-counterpart sources with faint reduced proper motions or interesting colors. We also establish a set of near-infrared spectroscopic standards with which to anchor near-infrared classifications for our objects. Among the discoveries are six young field brown dwarfs, five "red L" dwarfs, three L-type subdwarfs, twelve M-type subdwarfs, eight "blue L" dwarfs, and several T dwarfs. We further refine the definitions of these exotic classes to aid future identification of similar objects. We examine their kinematics and find that both the "blue L" and "red L" dwarfs appear to be drawn from a relatively old population. This survey provides a glimpse of the kinds of research that will be possible through time-domain infrared projects such as the UKIDSS Large Area Survey, various VISTA surveys, and WISE, and also through z- or y-band enabled, multi-epoch surveys such as Pan-STARRS and LSST.  Some of the spectroscopic data presented herein were obtained at the W. M. Keck Observatory, which is operated as a scientific partnership among the California Institute of Technology, the University of California, and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. The Observatory was made possible by the generous financial support of the W. M. Keck Foundation. Other spectroscopic data were collected at the Subaru Telescope, which is operated by the National Astronomical Observatory of Japan.},

	Abstract = {We report the discovery of the wide L1.5+L4.5 binary 2MASS J15200224-4422419AB, identified during spectroscopic follow-up of high proper motion sources selected from the Two Micron All Sky Survey. This source was independently identified by Kendall et al. in the SuperCOSMOS Sky Survey. Resolved JHK photometry and low-resolution near-infrared spectroscopy demonstrate that this system is composed of two well-separated (1.174''+/-0.016'') L dwarfs. Component classifications are derived using both spectral ratios and comparison to the near-infrared spectra of previously classified field L dwarfs. Physical association for the pair is deduced from the large common proper motion of the components (mu=0.73''+/-0.03'' yr-1) and their similar spectrophotometric distances (19+/-2 pc). The projected separation of the binary, 22+/-2 AU, is consistent with maximum separation/total system-mass trends for very low mass binaries. The 2MASS J1520-4422 system exhibits both large tangential (66+/-7 km s-1) and radial velocities (-70+/-18 km s-1), and its motion in the local standard of rest suggests that it is an old member of the Galactic disk population. This system joins a growing list of well-separated (>0.5"), very low mass binaries, and is an excellent target for resolved optical spectroscopy to constrain its age, as well as trace activity/rotation trends near the hydrogen-burning limit.},

	Abstract = {Evidence is presented that 2MASS J03202839-0446358, a late-type dwarf with discrepant optical (M8:) and near-infrared (L1) spectral types, is an as-yet unresolved stellar/brown dwarf binary with late-type M dwarf and T dwarf components. This conclusion is based on low-resolution, near-infrared spectroscopy that reveals a subtle but distinctive absorption feature at 1.6 mu m . The feature, which is also present in the combined light spectrum of the M8.5 + T6 binary SCR 1845-6357, arises from the combination of FeH absorption from an M8.5 primary and pseudocontinuum flux from a T5 $\pm$ 1 secondary, as ascertained from binary spectral templates constructed from empirical data. The binary templates provide a far superior match to the overall near-infrared spectral energy distribution of 2MASS J0320-0446 than any single comparison spectra. Laser guide star adaptive optics (LGS AO) imaging observations, including the first application of LGS AO aperture mask interferometry, fail to resolve a faint companion, restricting the projected separation of the system to less than 8.3 AU at the time of observation. 2MASS J0320-0446 is the second very low mass binary to be identified from unresolved, low-resolution, near-infrared spectroscopy, a technique that complements traditional high-resolution imaging and spectroscopic methods.

Keck Observatory, which is operated as a scientific partnership among the California Institute of Technology, the University of California, and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.

	Abstract = {We report the identification of 17 candidate brown dwarf binaries whose components straddle the L dwarf/T dwarf transition. These sources were culled from a large near-infrared spectral sample of L and T dwarfs observed with the Infrared Telescope Facility SpeX spectrograph. Candidates were selected on the basis of spectral ratios which segregate known (resolved) L dwarf/T dwarf pairs from presumably single sources. Composite templates, constructed by combining 13,581 pairs of absolute flux-calibrated spectra, are shown to provide statistically superior fits to the spectra of our 17 candidates as compared to single templates. Ten of these candidates appear to have secondary components that are significantly brighter than their primaries over the 1.0-1.3 mum band, indicative of rapid condensate depletion at the L dwarf/T dwarf transition. Our results support prior indications of enhanced multiplicity amongst early-type T dwarfs; 53% $\pm$ 7% of the T0-T4 dwarfs in our spectral sample are found to be either resolved or unresolved (candidate) pairs, although this is consistent with an intrinsic (volume complete) brown dwarf binary fraction of only 15%. If verified, this sample of spectral binaries more than doubles the number of known L dwarf/T dwarf transition pairs, enabling a broader exploration of this poorly understood phase of brown dwarf atmospheric evolution.},

	Abstract = {We present the discovery of seven new T dwarfs identified in the Two Micron All Sky Survey. Low-resolution (R~150) 0.8-2.5 mum spectroscopy obtained with the Infrared Telescope Facility (IRTF) SpeX instrument reveals the characteristic H2O and CH4 bands in the spectra of these brown dwarfs. Comparison with spectral standards observed with the same instrument enables us to derive classifications of T3 to T7 for the objects in this sample. Moderate-resolution (R~1200) near-infrared spectroscopy for a subset of these discoveries reveal K I line strengths consistent with previously observed trends with spectral type. Follow-up imaging observations provide proper-motion measurements for these sources, ranging from less than 0.1" to 1.55" yr-1. One object, 2MASS 0034+0523, has a spectrophotometric distance placing it within 10 pc of the Sun. This source also exhibits a depressed K-band peak reminiscent of the peculiar T dwarf 2MASS 0937+2931 and may be a metal-poor or old, high-mass brown dwarf. We also present low-resolution SpeX data for a set of M- and L-type dwarf, subdwarf, and giant comparison stars used to classify 59 additional candidates identified as background stars. These are primarily M5-M8.5 dwarfs, many exhibiting H I Pagamma, but include three candidate ultracool M subdwarfs and one possible early-type L subdwarf.},

	Abstract = {We present the peculiar near-infrared spectrum of the newly discovered brown dwarf 2MASS J05185995-2828372, identified in the Two Micron All Sky Survey. Features characteristic of both L and T dwarfs are present, namely, strong carbon monoxide absorption in the K band, strong methane absorption in the J and H bands, and red near-infrared colors. We consider several scenarios that could produce these features and conclude that the object is most likely to be an unresolved L/T binary system. We discuss how the estimated photometric properties of this object are consistent with the observed J-band brightening of brown dwarfs between late-L and early-T dwarfs, making detailed study of this system an important probe of the L/T transition.},

Spectral types are derived from resolved near-infrared spectroscopy of the well-separated (1.09"+/-0.06") components and comparison to equivalent data for M and L dwarf spectral standards. Physical association is deduced from the angular proximity of the sources, their common proper motion, and their similar spectrophotometric distances (35+/-2 pc). The estimated distance of this pair implies a projected separation of 38+/-3 AU, wider than typical separations for other M dwarf/L dwarf binaries but consistent with the maximum separation/total system mass trend previously identified by Burgasser et al. We discuss the DENIS 2200-3038AB system in context with other low-mass binaries and its role in the study of dust formation processes and activity trends across the transition between the M and L dwarf spectral classes.},

The stars have well-established MK spectral classifications and are mostly restricted to near-solar metallicities. The sample not only contains the F, G, K, and M spectral types with luminosity classes between I and V, but also includes some AGB, carbon, and S stars. In contrast to some other spectral libraries, the continuum shape of the spectra is measured and preserved in the data reduction process. The spectra are absolutely flux calibrated using the Two Micron All Sky Survey photometry. Potential uses of the library include studying the physics of cool stars, classifying and studying embedded young clusters and optically obscured regions of the Galaxy, evolutionary population synthesis to study unresolved stellar populations in optically obscured regions of galaxies and synthetic photometry. The library is available in digital form from the IRTF Web site.},

	Abstract = {The monochromatic illumination system is constructed to carry out in situ measurements of the response function of the mosaicked CCD imager used in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). The system is outlined and the results of the measurements, mostly during the first six years of the SDSS, are described. We present the reference response functions for the five color passbands derived from these measurements, and discuss column-to-column variations and variations in time, and also their effects on photometry. We also discuss the effect arising from various, slightly different response functions of the associated detector systems that were used to give SDSS photometry. We show that the calibration procedures of SDSS remove these variations reasonably well with the resulting final errors from variant response functions being unlikely to be larger than 0.01 mag for g, r, i, and z bands over the entire duration of the survey. The considerable aging effect is uncovered in the u band, the response function showing a 30% decrease in the throughput in the short wavelength side during the survey years, which potentially causes a systematic error in photometry. The aging effect is consistent with variation of the instrumental sensitivity in the u band, which is calibrated out. The expected color variation is consistent with measured color variation in the catalog of repeated photometry. The color variation is Delta(u - g) ~ 0.01 for most stars, and at most Delta(u - g) ~ 0.02 mag for those with extreme colors. We verified in the final catalog that no systematic variations in excess of 0.01 mag are detected in the photometry which can be ascribed to aging and/or seasonal effects except for the secular u - g color variation for stars with extreme colors.},

	Abstract = {We combine optical, near-infrared, and mid-infrared spectra and photometry to construct expanded spectral energy distributions for 145 field age (>500 Myr) and 53 young (lower age estimate <500 Myr) ultracool dwarfs (M6-T9). This range of spectral types includes very low mass stars, brown dwarfs, and planetary mass objects, providing fundamental parameters across both the hydrogen and deuterium burning minimum masses for the largest sample assembled to date. A subsample of 29 objects have well constrained ages as probable members of a nearby young moving group. We use 182 parallaxes and 16 kinematic distances to determine precise bolometric luminosities (Lbol) and radius estimates from evolutionary models give semi-empirical effective temperatures (Teff) for the full range of young and field age late-M, L, and T dwarfs. We construct age-sensitive relationships of luminosity, temperature, and absolute magnitude as functions of spectral type and absolute magnitude to disentangle the effects of degenerate physical parameters such as Teff, surface gravity, and clouds on spectral morphology. We report bolometric corrections in J for both field age and young objects and find differences of up to a magnitude for late-L dwarfs. Our correction in Ks shows a larger dispersion but not necessarily a different relationship for young and field age sequences. We also characterize the NIR-MIR reddening of low gravity L dwarfs and identify a systematically cooler Teff of up to 300 K from field age objects of the same spectral type and 400 K cooler from field age objects of the same MH magnitude.},

We are engaged in a multifaceted search for nearby late-type objects, and this is the first installment of our search using purely photometric selection. The goal of this work is a determination of the low-mass star and brown dwarf luminosity function in the infrared. Here we outline the construction of the sample, dubbed 2MU2, and present our first results, including the discovery of 186 M7-L6 dwarfs-47 of which are likely to be within 20 pc of the Sun. These results represent 66% of the ultracool candidates in our sample yet constitute a 127% increase in the number of ultracool dwarfs known within the volume searched (covering 40% of the sky out to 20 pc). In addition, we have identified 10 M4-M6.5 objects that are likely to be within 20 pc (or within 1 sigma). Finally, based on these initial data, we present a preliminary luminosity function and discuss several interesting features of the partial sample presented here. Once our sample is complete, we will use our measured luminosity function to constrain the mass function of low-mass stars and brown dwarfs.},

	Abstract = {We present a spectroscopic catalog of 70,841 visually inspected M dwarfs from the seventh data release of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. For each spectrum, we provide measurements of the spectral type, a number of molecular band heads, and the Halpha, Hbeta, Hgamma, Hdelta, and Ca II K emission lines. In addition, we calculate the metallicity-sensitive parameter zeta and identify a relationship between zeta and the g - r and r - z colors of M dwarfs. We assess the precision of our spectral types (which were assigned by individual examination), review the bulk attributes of the sample, and examine the magnetic activity properties of M dwarfs, in particular those traced by the higher order Balmer transitions. Our catalog is cross-matched to Two Micron All Sky Survey infrared data, and contains photometric distances for each star. Finally, we identify eight new late-type M dwarfs that are possibly within 25 pc of the Sun. Future studies will use these data to thoroughly examine magnetic activity and kinematics in late-type M dwarfs and examine the chemical and dynamical history of the local Milky Way.},

	Abstract = {We report on new measurements of the luminosity function (LF) and mass function (MF) of field low-mass dwarfs derived from Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 6 photometry. The analysis incorporates ~15 million low-mass stars (0.1 M_o M < 0.8 M_o), spread over 8400 deg2. Stellar distances are estimated using new photometric parallax relations, constructed from ugriz photometry of nearby low-mass stars with trigonometric parallaxes. We use a technique that simultaneously measures Galactic structure and the stellar LF from 7 < Mr < 16. We compare the LF to previous studies and convert to an MF using the mass-luminosity relations of Delfosse et al. The system MF, measured over -1.0< log M / M_o <-0.1, is well described by a lognormal distribution with M_{\circ } = 0.25 M_o. We stress that our results should not be extrapolated to other mass regimes. Our work generally agrees with prior low-mass stellar MFs and places strong constraints on future theoretical star formation studies.},

	Abstract = {We present a sample of 484 L dwarfs, 210 of which are newly discovered from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) Data Release 7 spectroscopic database. We combine this sample with known L dwarfs to investigate their izJHKS colors. Our spectroscopically selected sample has ~0.1 mag bluer median J - KS color at a given spectral type (for L0-L4) than previously known L dwarfs, which reflects a bias toward redder L dwarfs in past selection criteria. We present photometric distance relations based on i - z and i - J colors and derive distances to our L dwarf sample. We combine the distances with SDSS/2MASS proper motions in order to examine the tangential velocities. For the majority of our spectroscopic sample, we measured radial velocities and present three-dimensional kinematics. We also provide Halpha detections for the fraction of our sample with sufficient quality spectra. Comparison of the velocities of our L dwarf sample to a kinematic model shows evidence for both cold and hot dynamical populations, consistent with young and old disk components. The dispersions of these components are similar to those found for M dwarfs. We also show that J - KS color is correlated with velocity dispersion, confirming a relationship between J - KS color and age.},

	Abstract = {We present the colors and activity of ultracool (M7--L8) dwarfs from the Tenth Data Release of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). We combine previous samples of SDSS M and L dwarfs with new data obtained from the Baryon Oscillation Sky Survey (BOSS) to produce the BOSS Ultracool Dwarf (BUD) sample of 11820 M7--L8 dwarfs. By combining SDSS data with photometry from 2MASS and the Wide-field Infrared Sky Explorer (WISE) mission, we present ultracool dwarf colors from i-z to W2-W3 as a function of spectral type, and extend the SDSS--2MASS--WISE color locus to include ultracool dwarfs. The i-z, i-J, and z-J colors provide the best indication of spectral type for M7--L3 dwarfs. We also examine ultracool dwarf chromospheric activity through the presence and strength of Hα emission. The fraction of active dwarfs rises through the M spectral sequence until it reaches ∼90% at spectral type L0. The fraction of active dwarfs then declines to 50% at spectral type L5; no Hα emission is observed in the late-L dwarfs in the BUD sample. The fraction of active L0--L5 dwarfs is much higher than previously observed. The strength of activity declines with spectral type from M7 through L3, after which the data do not show a clear trend. Using one-dimensional chromosphere models, we explore the range of filling factors and chromospheric temperature structures that are consistent with Hα observations of M0--L7 dwarfs. M dwarf chromospheres have a similar, smoothly varying range of temperature and surface coverage, while L dwarf chromospheres are cooler and have smaller filling factors.},

	Abstract = {We present optical template spectra, bolometric corrections, and χ values for ultracool dwarfs. The templates are based on spectra from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) and the Astrophysical Research Consortium 3.5 m telescope. The spectral features and overall shape of the L dwarf templates are consistent with previous spectroscopic standards and the templates have a radial velocity precision of ˜10-20 km s-1. We calculate bolometric fluxes (accurate to 10-20%) for 101 late-M and L dwarfs from SDSS, 2MASS, and WISE photometry, SDSS spectra, and BT-Settl model spectra. We find that the z-band and J-band bolometric corrections for late-M and L dwarfs have a strong correlation with z-J and J-KScolors, respectively. The new χ values, which can be used to convert Hα equivalent widths to activity strength, are based on spectrophotometrically calibrated SDSS spectra and the new bolometric fluxes. While the measured χ values have typical uncertainties of ˜20%, ultracool dwarf models show the continuum surrounding Hα can vary by up to an order of magnitude with changing surface gravity. Our semiempirical χ values are one to two orders of magnitude larger than previous χ values for mid-to-late L dwarfs, indicating that the upper limits for Hα activity strength on the coolest L dwarfs have been underestimated.},

	Abstract = {Precise and accurate parameters for late-type (late K and M) dwarf stars are important for characterization of any orbiting planets, but such determinations have been hampered by these stars' complex spectra and dissimilarity to the Sun. We exploit an empirically calibrated method to estimate spectroscopic effective temperature (Teff) and the Stefan--Boltzmann law to determine radii of 183 nearby K7--M7 single stars with a precision of 2%--5%. Our improved stellar parameters enable us to develop model-independent relations between Teff or absolute magnitude and radius, as well as between color and Teff. The derived Teff--radius relation depends strongly on [Fe/H], as predicted by theory. The relation between absolute KS magnitude and radius can predict radii accurate to ≃ 3%. We derive bolometric corrections to the V{{R}C}{{I}C}grizJH{{K}S} and Gaia passbands as a function of color, accurate to 1%--3%. We confront the reliability of predictions from Dartmouth stellar evolution models using a Markov chain Monte Carlo to find the values of unobservable model parameters (mass, age) that best reproduce the observed effective temperature and bolometric flux while satisfying constraints on distance and metallicity as Bayesian priors. With the inferred masses we derive a semi-empirical mass--absolute magnitude relation with a scatter of 2% in mass. The best-agreement models overpredict stellar Teff values by an average of 2.2% and underpredict stellar radii by 4.6%, similar to differences with values from low-mass eclipsing binaries. These differences are not correlated with metallicity, mass, or indicators of activity, suggesting issues with the underlying model assumptions, e.g., opacities or convective mixing length.},
